Q.10- What will the following code's output be in sequence and explain why?
      function printNumber(num) {
        console.log(num);
       }
       
      console.log(1);
      setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);
      setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);
      console.log(4);
Ans:-
     Output->   1  4  2  3
     the output is in the sequence: 1, 4, 2, 3. This is because of the asynchronous behavior of setTimeout, 
     which schedules the functions to be executed after a specified delay but doesn't block the execution
     of the rest of the code.
