Q11. Check the below given code, if there are any issues, fix them and explain the output

    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
      if (num % 2 === 0) {
        acc.evens.push(num);
      } else {
        acc.odds.push(num);
      }
      return acc;
    });
    console.log(result);

Ans:-The given code has an issue because the initial value for the reduce method is not provided. 
The reduce method should have an initial value as its second argument, otherwise, the first element of
the array will be used as the initial value. In this case, the first element of the array is 1, so the 
accumulator acc will be an object with the properties odds and evens, but those properties will be
undefined because they don't exist in the initial value.

Corrected Code-
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { odds: [], evens: [] });

console.log(result);
