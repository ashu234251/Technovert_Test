 Q.7- Use Array.reduce() method to reverse the following given array
      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Ans:
     const givenArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

     const reversedArray = givenArray.reduce((acc, current) => {
     return [current, ...acc];
     }, []);

     console.log(reversedArray);
     
In this example, we start with an empty array as the initial value for the accumulator ([]). In each iteration, we add the current element at the beginning of the accumulator using the spread operator (...acc).
